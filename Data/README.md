## Data files for the USCMS diversity analysis  
The data files are stored in the `.json` format and can be obtained from the 'statistics' tab at [icms.cern.ch](https://icms.cern.ch/tools-api/restplus/).  The relevant files needed can be obtained from the following tabs, and should be renamed accordingly:
* 'statistics' > 'people' > Rename `.json` file as `people_new.json`
* 'statistics' > 'institutes' > Rename `.json` file as `institutes_new.json`
* 'statistics' > 'people_status' > Choose a date in %Y-%m-%d format > Rename `json` file as `people_stats_%Y%m%d`
